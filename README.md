<h1>BitPay - Decentralized Transaction Application</h1>

<p><strong>BitPay</strong> is a decentralized transaction application built on blockchain technology. It provides a secure and transparent platform for users to conduct peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries. With Coin Trust, users can transfer digital assets securely and trustlessly, ensuring the integrity and immutability of their transactions.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Decentralized Transactions</strong>: Coin Trust enables users to conduct transactions directly with one another without relying on centralized authorities.</li>
  <li><strong>Blockchain Technology</strong>: Built on blockchain technology, Coin Trust ensures the security and immutability of transactions through distributed ledger technology.</li>
  <li><strong>Transparent and Auditable</strong>: All transactions on Coin Trust are transparent and auditable, allowing users to track the flow of assets on the blockchain.</li>
  <li><strong>Secure</strong>: With cryptographic algorithms and consensus mechanisms, Coin Trust provides a secure environment for users to transact without the risk of fraud or manipulation.</li>
  <li><strong>Wallet Integration</strong>: Users can manage their digital assets conveniently through wallet integration, providing easy access to funds for transactions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How It Works</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>User Registration</strong>: Users can register on the Coin Trust platform by creating an account.</li>
  <li><strong>Asset Management</strong>: Users can manage their digital assets within their wallets, including cryptocurrencies and tokens supported by the Coin Trust platform.</li>
  <li><strong>Initiating Transactions</strong>: To initiate a transaction, users specify the recipient's email address, the amount to be transferred, and some basic additional transaction details.</li>
  <li><strong>Transaction Verification</strong>: Transactions are verified and confirmed by the blockchain network through consensus mechanisms, ensuring the validity and integrity of each transaction.</li>
  <li><strong>Transaction Settlement</strong>: Once verified, transactions are recorded on the blockchain and settled, updating the balance of digital assets in the sender's and recipient's wallets accordingly.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Technology Stack</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Blockchain</strong>: Coin Trust utilizes a decentralized blockchain network for transaction processing and validation.</li>
  <li><strong>Smart Contracts</strong>: Smart contracts are employed to automate and enforce transaction rules and agreements on the blockchain.</li>
  <li><strong>Cryptographic Algorithms</strong>: Cryptographic algorithm SHA-256 is used for secure key generation and transaction validation.</li>
  <li><strong>Consensus Mechanisms</strong>: Consensus mechanism Proof of Work (PoW) ensures agreement among network participants on the validity of transactions.</li>
  <li><strong>Node.js</strong>: Node.js is used to create the server.</li>
</ul>
